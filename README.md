# LLMs Reading LLMs: Exploring Hugging Face Models with NotebookLM

This project explores how Google’s NotebookLM, an AI-powered research assistant, can be used to interactively question and analyze model documentation from Hugging Face’s Transformers library.

I uploaded multiple model cards (such as FLAN-T5, DistilBERT, and GPT-2) into NotebookLM and asked it a series of technical, comparative, and ethical questions. This unique setup allows us to evaluate how a document-grounded LLM assistant interprets real-world model documentation without hallucination.
